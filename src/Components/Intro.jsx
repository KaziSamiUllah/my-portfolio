        Welcome to my portfolio! As I embark on my journey in the dynamic field
        of web development, I am at the beginning stages of building my
        expertise. My adventure in technology started with earning a Bachelor of
        Science in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the
        International Islamic University Chittagong. Since graduation, I have
        dedicated myself to acquiring practical experience and enhancing my
        skills in web development.
