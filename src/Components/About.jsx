          Welcome to my portfolio! As I embark on my journey in the dynamic
          field of web development, I am at the beginning stages of building my
          expertise. My adventure in technology started with earning a Bachelor
          of Science in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the
          International Islamic University Chittagong. Since graduation, I have
          dedicated myself to acquiring practical experience and enhancing my
          skills in web development. I am based in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and I
          have a keen interest in both front-end and back-end development. My
          professional journey has equipped me with a robust foundation in IT,
          having worked as a Senior Executive (IT) at Meenhar Securities Ltd.
          and as a Deputy Engineer at Broad Band Telecom Services Ltd. These
          roles have honed my technical skills and reinforced my passion for
          problem-solving and innovation in technology.
